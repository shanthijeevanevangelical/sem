                        <!-- <p>Shanthi Jeevan Evangelical Mission was founded with a divine calling to serve the "least of these." What started as a small prayer group has grown into a multifaceted ministry touching thousands of lives across the region.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p>Driven by the compassion of Christ, we stepped out to address not just the spiritual void but also the pressing physical and social needs of our community. From caring for those stigmatized by HIV/AIDS to educating children who had no hope for a future, our journey has been one of faith and miracles.</p> -->

                               <p> Dharmapuri is one of the most backward districts in Tamil Nadu and has a very small
                                Christian population. As a family, we started our ministry in Dharmapuri by choosing a
                                highly populated area and living in a rented home.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>We reached out to the community by sharing the Gospel through tract distribution and
                                Jesus film screenings, and by practicing wholistic evangelism such as guiding the sick
                                to hospitals and conducting free medical camps.</p>
                            </li>

                                We supported needy children by helping them get admission into free schools, providing
                                educational assistance such as fees, notebooks, and school bags, and offering Christian
                                counseling to people suffering from depression.</p>

                            handed over to the Methodist Church of India.</p>
